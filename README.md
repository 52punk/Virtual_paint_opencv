# Virtual_paint_opencv
This is a virtual paint program which is made by using opencv in python.

There are two source codes, 1st code --> object_detection_1.py, this file contains the code for getting the specific color code for the color we need in the paint program (in HSV format).
2nd file --> virtual_paint.py, this file contains the code for the paint program, each line of code is described in the program itself by commenting the line in python, You can easily understand the program by reading the comment lines.

This project was inspired from Ali Mortaza's project.

Thank you.
